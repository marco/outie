# Outie üê¨

Outie is the Outdoor Ed "matchmaking" project for Chadwick School. It contains
a frontend using React, Babel, and Sass as well as a backend using Node.js and
Firebase.

## Installation

 1. After cloning the project, install all required dependencies with `npm install`.

 2. Add a `firebase-service-key.json` file to `src` containing Firebase
    authorization credentials.

 3. Update `web/src/database` to use your own Firebase frontend credentials.

## Usage

The server can be built and ran using:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

Additionally, a live-reloading development mode can be started with:

```bash
npm run listen
```

To run the algorithm, use `npm run choose` with parameters for grade name,
the number of groups, and the number of iteration attempts. A `--verbose` mode
can also be specified.

```bash
npm run choose -- gradeExample 6 10000 --verbose
```

You can also copy data from the legacy database by using the `update-db-from-json.js`
script with old students and preferences JSON files.

```bash
node src/update-db-from-json.js old-students.json old-preferences.json
```

## Algorithm

In summary, the group-making algorithm works as follows:

 - Start with completely empty groups.
 - Randomly loop through all students who listed preferences.
    - Rank the groups in order from the one with the most of their friends to the
      least.
    - In this order, check if the groups are full.
       - If it isn't, add the new user and move to the next user.
       - If they are full, check if the new user is more "well liked" than any
         other user in the group.
          - If not, try the user's next favorite group.
          - If they are, add them and remove the other user.
    - Continue looping through all registered users until all have been
      placed in a group, or there are no more spaces without exceeding the
      tentative maximum number of students per group.
 - Then, loop through all users who didn't register or couldn't be placed.
    - Sort all groups by least-populated to most-populated.
    - Loop through the groups in order.
       - If the student can be added without any gender or sizing conflicts,
         add them. Otherwise, keep looping.
    - If there are still remaining users, loop through groups again, now ignoring
      gender. Lastly, loop ignoring gender and group size to confirm all users
      are placed.
 - Once all users have been placed, the algorithm is complete!
